# # Road Follower - Train Model
# 
# In this notebook we will train a neural network to take an input image, and output a set of x, y values corresponding to a target.
# 
# We will be using PyTorch deep learning framework to train ResNet18 neural network architecture model for road follower application.

# ### Download and extract data
# 
# Before you start, you should upload the ``road_following_<Date&Time>.zip`` file that you created in the ``data_collection.ipynb`` notebook on the robot. 
# 
# > If you're training on the JetBot you collected data on, you can skip this!
# 
# You should then extract this dataset by calling the command below:




get_ipython().system('unzip -q road_following.zip')


# You should see a folder named ``dataset_all`` appear in the file browser.

# ### Create Dataset Instance
# 
# Here we create a custom ``torch.utils.data.Dataset`` implementation, which implements the ``__len__`` and ``__getitem__`` functions.  This class
# is responsible for loading images and parsing the x, y values from the image filenames.  Because we implement the ``torch.utils.data.Dataset`` class,
# we can use all of the torch data utilities :)
# 
# We hard coded some transformations (like color jitter) into our dataset.  We made random horizontal flips optional (in case you want to follow a non-symmetric path, like a road
# where we need to 'stay right').  If it doesn't matter whether your robot follows some convention, you could enable flips to augment the dataset.




def get_x(path, width):
    """Gets the x value from the image filename"""
    return (float(int(path.split("_")[1])) - width/2) / (width/2)

def get_y(path, height):
    """Gets the y value from the image filename"""
    return (float(int(path.split("_")[2])) - height/2) / (height/2)

    def __init__(self, directory, random_hflips=False):
        self.directory = directory
        self.random_hflips = random_hflips
        self.image_paths = glob.glob(os.path.join(self.directory, '*.jpg'))

        image = transforms.functional.to_tensor(image)
        image = image.numpy()[::-1].copy()
        image = torch.from_numpy(image)

# ### Split dataset into train and test sets
# Once we read dataset, we will split data set in train and test sets. In this example we split train and test a 90%-10%. The test set will be used to verify the accuracy of the model we train.


test_percent = 0.1
num_test = int(test_percent * len(dataset))
train_dataset, test_dataset = torch.utils.data.random_split(dataset, [len(dataset) - num_test, num_test])


# ### Create data loaders to load data in batches
# 
# We use ``DataLoader`` class to load data in batches, shuffle data and allow using multi-subprocesses. In this example we use batch size of 64. Batch size will be based on memory available with your GPU and it can impact accuracy of the model.




train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    train_dataset,
    batch_size=8,

    shuffle=True,
    num_workers=0
)


# ### Define Neural Network Model 
# 
# We use ResNet-18 model available on PyTorch TorchVision. 
# 
# In a process called transfer learning, we can repurpose a pre-trained model (trained on millions of images) for a new task that has possibly much less data available.
# 
# 
# More details on ResNet-18 : https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/resnet.py
# 
# More Details on Transfer Learning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yofjFQddwHE 


model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)


# ResNet model has fully connect (fc) final layer with 512 as ``in_features`` and we will be training for regression thus ``out_features`` as 1
# 
# Finally, we transfer our model for execution on the GPU




model.fc = torch.nn.Linear(512, 2)
device = torch.device('cuda')
model = model.to(device)


# ### Train Regression:
# 
# We train for 50 epochs and save best model if the loss is reduced. 



NUM_EPOCHS = 70

        torch.save(model.state_dict(), BEST_MODEL_PATH)
        best_loss = test_loss


# Once the model is trained, it will generate ``best_steering_model_xy.pth`` file which you can use for inferencing in the live demo notebook.
# 
# If you trained on a different machine other than JetBot, you'll need to upload this to the JetBot to the ``road_following`` example folder.
